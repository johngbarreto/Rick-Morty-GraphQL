# Rick-Morty-GraphQL

This app is a small, focused portfolio app built in SwiftUI.

The app lists characters and locations, infinite scroll pagination. 
Favorites and user data are planned to be stored in Core Data + Episodes screens 

What I focused on learning and using:

- GraphQL with Apollo as a SPM.
- Combine with SwiftUI using search with debounce and all the goodies.

The main focus of this app was to partice the implementation of Combine and GrahpQL.
