# Rick-Morty-GraphQL

This app is a small, focused portfolio app built in SwiftUI that explores different ways to handle asynchronous data and app architecture while integrating a real GraphQL API. 

The app lists characters and locations, infinite scroll pagination. 
Favorites and user data are planned to be stored in Core Data.

What I learned to apply:

- GraphQL with Apollo as a SPM.
- Combine for event streams, searching with debounce and publishers that are cancellation aware.
- Concurrency since I wanted to learn a bit more on how to use this pattern, which I thought it was a nice pair with GraphQL.

The main focus of this app was to simply learn and try things I haven't had the opportunity to do before, so it was worth while.
